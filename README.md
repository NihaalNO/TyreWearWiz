## Project Overview

**TyreWearWiz** is a focused Formula 1 data-visualization project that analyzes **tyre degradation, driver tyre management, and race strategy** using real race data.

Built entirely with **Python and Jupyter Notebook**, this project uses official F1 timing data via **FastF1** to transform raw telemetry into **clear, insightful visualizations**.

The project emphasizes:
- Why tyre degradation decides races  
- How drivers extend tyre life  
- How teams design race-winning strategies  

---

## What You Will Learn

By exploring this project, you will understand:

### 🛞 How Drivers Actually Manage Their Tyres
- Why drivers avoid pushing at maximum pace early in a stint  
- How smooth throttle and braking inputs reduce degradation  
- How lap time loss happens gradually, not suddenly  

### 🧠 How Teams Plan Race Strategies
- Why teams choose one-stop vs two-stop strategies  
- How tyre life defines pit windows  
- Why track position often outweighs raw pace  

### 🥇 Why P1 Often Never Loses the Lead
- How race leaders control pace to protect tyres  
- How clean air reduces sliding and overheating  
- How leaders force rivals into earlier pit stops  

> In Formula 1, the fastest driver does not always win —  
> the driver who **manages tyres best** usually does.

---

## Key Analyses Covered

### 1️⃣ Single Driver Tyre Degradation Analysis
- Lap Time vs Tyre Life curves  
- Compound-wise degradation trends  
- Degradation rate (seconds lost per lap)  

### 2️⃣ Comparing Drivers on Different Tyre Compounds
- Same compound, different drivers  
- Different compounds, same driver  
- Identifying superior tyre management  

### 3️⃣ Race Strategy Visualization
- F1-style horizontal stint charts  
- Pit stop timing analysis  
- Compound usage across the grid

## Data & Formats

### Data Source
**TyreWearWiz** leverages the **[FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1)** Python package to access official Formula 1 timing and telemetry data. FastF1 provides:
- Real-time and historical session data
- Lap-by-lap telemetry (speed, throttle, brake, gear, DRS, etc.)
- Session information (weather, track status, race control messages)
- Driver and team metadata

### Telemetry Parameters
Each visualization incorporates multiple telemetry channels:

| Parameter | Description | Unit |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Speed** | Car velocity | km/h |
| **Throttle** | Accelerator pedal position | % (0-100) |
| **Brake** | Brake pressure/activation | Binary or % |
| **Gear** | Current gear selection | 1-8 |
| **RPM** | Engine revolutions per minute | rpm |
| **DRS** | Drag Reduction System status | Binary |
| **X, Y** | Track position coordinates | Meters |
| **Distance** | Distance along track | Meters |
